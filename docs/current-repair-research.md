# Current SMP Repair Research

## Objective And Separation

This research serves the owner's current **9/12 -> 12/12** objective. It does not
recount native gates, replace the implementation owner's source or authorize an
execution. Current failure analysis and bounded source repair belong with the
existing executable models even when the cause or implementation is still open.
Only a changed architectural mechanism belongs in
[Experimental](../models/experimental/README.md). In particular, adding another
finite waiter phase is not itself a refactor milestone.

No runtime, compiler, source lock, qualification manifest, checkpoint or native
test is changed here. The current
[producer handoff](experimental/native-failure-producer-handoff.md) retains
the structure-consumer, compiler-representation, handler-generation and pending-
owner distinctions. These are research tracks, not a claim that they are the
three remaining native gate identities. Historical reports with older aggregate
counts do not reset the owner's current progress or certify a newer candidate.

Sources are pinned submodules: Gambit
`7c490c3ab5b5a4238b26f4a59d8cd9fd4b085882`, Chez
`41d5ffca7a07cbfc8807e719dedcc70ed74811cd`, OCaml
`46e1c324fb9e9f21f52c9cc3399020f7ef8b9b91`. Current overlay observations remain
distinct from those baselines and from an accepted executable.

## Pending Ownership: What Can Be Reused Now

| Existing model/proof | Relevant current contract | Still required from the actual candidate |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [root cleanup retention](../models/gambit/root_cleanup_sticky_retention.qnt) | Saved join failure retains storage/error and refuses destructive setup; P0 routing differs from merely requesting a pin. | A source-reachable recovery operation, actual exclusive host owner and same worker incarnation. Retained failure is not natural-error-then-success recovery. |
| [foreign origin retirement](../models/gambit/foreign_origin_owner_retirement.qnt) | Admission/frame publication, source-owned TLS, thread exit, successful join and reclamation are separate events. | New-owner attachment cannot be inferred from a P0 pointer or a zero frame count. The modeled valid callback runs on its owning OS thread. |
| [nested foreign unwind](../models/gambit/nested_foreign_unwind.qnt) | Inner and outer C frames clean up on their origins, exactly once, preserving the original outcome. | `routeOuter` is a source-refinement obligation, not an implemented transfer queue or permission to resume an expired C stack on another host thread. |
| [work accounting](../models/gambit/lean/WorkAccounting.lean) | `zeroCountAndEmptyQueuesExcludeHiddenWork` requires `ProducerLifetimeSafe`; `missingLifetimeCounterexample` already rejects a hidden producer. | Enumerate the actual private producers and their root/work handoff. The theorem cannot discover an omitted producer or make a partial snapshot complete. |

Reuse these existing counterexamples and contracts. No new generic QNT/Lean
model is needed merely to restate them. Their algorithmic sources are unchanged
so another thread's source-bound native acceptance is not invalidated.

## Collector Census Must Be Phase-Correct

Chez [thread.c](../vendor/chez/c/thread.c):261-341 processes remembered data,
closes thread-local allocation and transfers guardians before releasing `tc`;
it retains/recycles `thread_gc` because heap segments can still name that owner.
[alloc.c](../vendor/chez/c/alloc.c):305-323 requires its allocation mutex or
collector-guaranteed exclusivity when closing segments, then clears the segment
cursors. The useful unit is **owned data plus its collector interpretation and
last producer**, not simply the disappeared thread or an empty public queue.

OCaml [domain.c](../vendor/ocaml/runtime/domain.c):2262-2360 keeps a terminating
domain participating while emptying the minor heap and finishing/orphaning work.
Orphaning can create more marking/sweeping work, so completion is rechecked. Its
participant removal is serialized against incoming STW requests. Neither that
collector protocol nor Chez's segment closer is a drop-in Gambit operation.

Gambit [mem.c](../vendor/gambit/lib/mem.c):3251-3307 `end_heap_chunk` writes a
chunk marker/link, publishes FIFO data with two ordered barriers and may wake
scanners. It is a mutation of a particular collector phase, not a read-only
quiescence check. At 6991-7044, GC recovers `fp`/`hp`, sets up collector state
and performs phased marking; `prepare_mem_pstate`:4525-4564 publishes resulting
stack/heap pointers back to processor state. Therefore a cursor's initialization
or an address comparison alone does not establish that it describes all roots
and private work at the retirement boundary.

The inspected retained mutex-return overlay's `___transfer_mem_pstate` splices
still-object and
RC ownership under the memory lock. Its implementation does not by itself
enumerate all live Scheme activation roots, pending private scan work or queue
borrowers. The owner's cumulative patch was inspected at SHA-256
`49514f1819da3ca6008b07690e732a13625a54811a3e44a7da3615e25fdf0d55`;
that observation is not imported here as a reproducible source input or a newly
qualified producer. The already published producer handoff records the candidate
identity boundary. Do not infer that an unenumerated producer exists on every
legal path; the complete census and source phase remain obligations to discharge.

### Bounded Repair Recipe

The first-stage scope is the existing `setup.c` retirement/recovery caller and
`mem.c` ownership handoff, with generated state/root and foreign-frame boundaries
as dependencies. It preserves the C backend, FFI, proper tail calls, supported
continuations, ordinary allocation and resolved-access fast paths.
Qualification uses one repaired revision/effective configuration with all
affected generated/header-dependent objects rebuilt, not a new setup object
linked into an old archive. Applicable unchanged checkpoint stages remain reusable.

| Source join | Required evidence | Rejected shortcut |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Collective closure -> retirement | Match actual cohort/phase, completed callback return and the existing upward aggregation bridge. | Zero scan-worker count or a broadcast alone; adding a universal extra barrier without a demonstrated missing edge. |
| Retained donor -> collector-visible owner | Show which valid roots, still/RC state, private work and interpretation metadata remain owned or are transferred; publish under the collector's real phase/lock contract. | Calling `end_heap_chunk` from arbitrary cleanup, copying Chez's closer or setting a `fullProducerCensus` boolean. |
| Join-zero -> handoff -> clear | Bind the successful OS join to the same incarnation, retain joined-but-unhanded state if transfer is busy, and clear only after actual transfer completes. | Rejoining an already joined thread, or treating join success as complete root/borrower discharge. |
| Join error -> possible recovery | Establish a still-supported target and a legal exclusive source owner/entry; preserve original failure and resources until that operation succeeds. | Detached/self-join controls, injected errno, private pending-field writes or equating a normal join-zero fixture with real error recovery. |
| Exceptional C return -> owner release | Account for each actually acquired frame, root and entry effect on its origin, with the original outcome preserved. | Assuming cleanup after an ordinary C return also runs on every nonlocal exit, or transferring a raw TLS/frame pointer to a new host thread. |

This is a small-refactor candidate scope, **not** a selected runtime patch or a
promise that it closes the natural-error recovery gate. The implementation owner
must instantiate these conditions in its current repair package. If the needed
public owner-transfer operation is absent, that absence remains explicit; a
model must not manufacture the missing event or assert universal impossibility.

## Exception And OS Join Are Different Contracts

OCaml `domain.c`:1392-1455 routes backup-thread installation failure, domain
initialization failure and callback outcomes through its termination machinery
after successful domain creation. Rooted result publication is not a raw C
unwind that skips teardown. At 1512-1547, thread-creation failure frees the
parent's root carrier; successful creation transfers that carrier to the child,
the parent services STW requests while awaiting startup, and a started child
is **detached**. Startup failure takes the OS-join path. In
[domain.ml](../vendor/ocaml/stdlib/domain.ml):291-303, language `Domain.join`
waits for the termination result under its mutex and returns or rethrows it.
It is not successful retry of Gambit's pending `pthread_join`. Detaching an
already pending Gambit worker would destroy, not discharge, that obligation.

Chez [thread.c](../vendor/chez/c/thread.c):209-244 records whether an activation
created, reactivated or merely reused a context and reverses only that effect
on ordinary paired exit; the W/X branch differs. The libffi callback at
[ffi.c](../vendor/chez/c/ffi.c):604-623,692-700,793-797 uses this pairing.
It does not license moving another thread's live context or imply that its
ordinary callback tail is the whole nonlocal-unwind protocol.

Chez [schlib.c](../vendor/chez/c/schlib.c):217-289 explicitly maintains a C-chain,
jump buffers and code retention for nested returns/errors. Its
[foreign-call contract](../vendor/chez/csug/foreign.stex):1375-1410 explains
that stale foreign return contexts are trapped; arbitrary continuation
invocation is not permission to return through a stale C frame. Thus a proposed
new recovery owner needs a live entry and supported return protocol, not just
retained heap bytes or a copied old context. Preserve Gambit's own continuation
and FFI behavior instead of importing Chez's ABI or assuming OCaml exceptions
have identical control semantics.

## Architectural Work Kept Separate

Generalized host attachment/owner capabilities, independent root/synchronization
carriers across VM destruction, or decoupling language completion from OS-thread
ownership require explicit lifecycle/GC/FFI redesign and coordinated migration.
Those are Experimental milestones, not small bookkeeping fixes or permission to
replace Gambit's shared heap, C backend or supported continuations. The existing
[architectural composition](experimental/retirement-handoff-model.md) checks
some conditional subcontracts but is not a complete redesign or current repair.

The current lane instead binds the actual failure and proposed bounded repair
to existing models, source/configuration and native obligations. Formal passes,
mirrors and source observations never add a native gate. This audit supplies
source requirements and falsifiers; the separate implementation thread owns
source changes and complete native/Gerbil acceptance.

## Research Validation

Published HEAD `75e1c76fab056516d086a9cd4f706fac5e155c18` passed
[framework CI 39355702990](https://github.com/tao3k/gambit-SMP/actions/runs/39355702990):
1,809 tests, zero failures/errors/skips, complete inventory and unchanged inputs,
400.406603766 s, `frameworkValidated=true`, `runtimeAdmitted=false`.
Artifact `12234804078` has `test-result.json` SHA-256
`98a0a3d2a9095d8e81b4d54ff60452a5bc322b7dcc18886435acbd4ee6a3edca`.
This exact-head pass precedes the current research supplement.

The existing Scheme consumer checks this supplement's source/model hashes,
expands its source-section/premise correspondences, withdraws/restores the new
sources and preserves explicit missing native requirements. Current and
architectural evidence remain partial and `satisfies=[]`; neither can qualify
the other. Two existing current-correspondence/link checks passed in 7.738 s,
and the architecture's Scheme consumer passed in 3.221 s. Final document/hash
updates are checked again without repeating unchanged formal or native work.

No QNT/Lean algorithm or theorem source changed and no new formal pass is claimed
for these reused contracts. The separate implementing workers retain ownership
of their source/model repair packages. This research introduced no native run,
Grok launch, bootstrap, debugger, runtime change, checkpoint reset or budget
change; it does not increment or downgrade the owner's 9/12 count.
